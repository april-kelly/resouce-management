    <h1>Hello,</h1>

    <p>
        It appears that you do not have a setting.json file. This is the configuration file that tells The Bluetent
        Resource Management System how to work. No need to worry though, this probably just means that you are
        installing this for the for first time. Simply run the <a href="./step1.php">installer</a> and you will be good to go!
    </p>

        configuration files. To repair an existing install <a href="../config/reset.php">click here</a>.
